      <p className="text-lg text-black mb-12">
        Your bedroom color does more than look pretty - it sets the emotional
        tone of the space. The right paint color can make a bedroom feel calm,
        romantic, luxurious, cozy, or even energizing. Whether you’re
        redecorating or starting from scratch, these paint colors are timeless,
        realistic, and interior-designer approved.

          1. Warm White / Soft Ivory
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p className="text-lg text-black mb-16">
        Warm whites create a bedroom that feels fresh but not cold. Unlike stark
        white, warm white reflects light gently, making the room feel larger,
        brighter, and more peaceful. This color works exceptionally well if your
        bedroom lacks natural light or feels cramped.
        <br /><br />
        It’s also the most versatile backdrop: you can easily change bedding,
        wall art, or furniture without repainting. Warm white gives a
        hotel-like, high-end feel and makes textures like linen, wood, and soft
        rugs stand out beautifully.
      </p>

        <h2 className="absolute bottom-6 left-6 text-2xl font-serif text-white bg-black/50 px-4 py-2 rounded">
          2. Soft Sage Green
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p className="text-lg text-black mb-16">
        Sage green brings the outdoors inside, creating a calming environment
        that naturally reduces visual stress. It’s ideal for bedrooms because it
        promotes rest while still feeling stylish and modern. Unlike bright
        greens, sage is muted and soft — perfect for long-term use.
        <br /><br />
        This color pairs beautifully with neutral furniture, wooden tones, and
        indoor plants. If you want your bedroom to feel like a peaceful retreat
        rather than just a sleeping space, sage green delivers that effortlessly.

      <div className="relative mb-14">

          alt="Beige bedroom"

        <h2 className="absolute bottom-6 left-6 text-2xl font-serif text-white bg-black/50 px-4 py-2 rounded">
          3. Warm Beige
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p className="text-lg text-black mb-16">
        Beige and greige tones are perfect if you want your bedroom to feel
        soft, welcoming, and cozy without being dark. These colors add warmth
        while keeping the space neutral and sophisticated.
        <br /><br />
        They work especially well in bedrooms meant for relaxation after long
        days. Beige tones complement almost all decor styles — from modern to
        rustic — and give the room a layered, lived-in feel that never goes out
        of style.

          alt="Blush pink bedroom"

        <h2 className="absolute bottom-6 left-6 text-2xl font-serif text-white bg-black/50 px-4 py-2 rounded">
          4. Blush Pink / Dusty Rose
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p className="text-lg text-black mb-16">
        Blush pink is subtle yet powerful. It adds warmth and personality
        without overpowering the room. When done right, it feels elegant and
        mature, not childish.
        <br /><br />
        This color creates a soothing, emotionally comforting atmosphere,
        making it perfect for bedrooms that need to feel intimate and relaxing.
        It pairs beautifully with gold accents, soft whites, and neutral
        furniture — giving the room a soft luxury vibe.

        <h2 className="absolute bottom-6 left-6 text-2xl font-serif text-white bg-black/50 px-4 py-2 rounded">
          5. Soft Gray (Warm Undertone)
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p className="text-lg text-black mb-16">
        Warm gray tones strike the perfect balance between modern and cozy.
        They add structure to a bedroom without making it feel cold or sterile.
        This makes them ideal for people who love clean lines but still want a
        relaxing atmosphere.
        <br /><br />
        Soft gray also enhances contrast — white bedding looks crisper, dark
        furniture feels richer, and metallic accents stand out beautifully. It’s
        a great option if you want a modern bedroom that still feels restful.

        <h2 className="absolute bottom-6 left-6 text-2xl font-serif text-white bg-black/50 px-4 py-2 rounded">
          6. Deep Navy Blue
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p className="text-lg text-black">
        Navy blue creates a cocoon-like effect, making bedrooms feel intimate.
        It’s perfect for people who love darker, moodier interiors but still
        want elegance.
        <br /><br />
        This color absorbs light just enough to promote relaxation while adding
        a sense of luxury. Paired with light bedding, brass accents, or soft
        lighting, navy transforms a bedroom into a high-end retreat that feels
        intentional and stylish.
